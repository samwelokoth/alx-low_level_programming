# Unveiling the Power of Makefiles: Revolutionizing Development Workflow

## Project Overview

Embark on a journey into the realm of Makefiles, where we unveil the magic of automation and efficiency. In this endeavor, we dive deep into the intricacies of Makefiles, transforming mundane tasks into streamlined processes. By harnessing the power of Makefiles, we enhance productivity, simplify code compilation, and conquer complex dependencies, ushering in a new era of development excellence.

## Testing Suite üõ†Ô∏è

- [tests](./tests): A treasure trove of test files awaits exploration.

## Auxiliary Assets üåü

- [school.c](./school.c): Behold a mesmerizing seahorse rendered in text form, courtesy of a C function. A delightful companion throughout our Makefile odyssey.
  
- [main.c](./main.c): The maestro orchestrating the performance, ensuring our seahorse captivates the audience as intended.

## Header Repository üìÅ

- [m.h](./m.h): A sanctuary of function prototypes, facilitating seamless communication between code components and ensuring harmony within our codebase.

## Task Breakdown üìã

### 0. Foundational Makefile Setup

- **Objective**: Lay the groundwork with a basic Makefile (`0-Makefile`) to compile and link `school.c` and `main.c` into the enchanting executable named `school`.
- **Key Features**:
  - Introduction of the `all` rule to summon forth the executable.

### 1. Elevated Compilation with Variables

- **Objective**: Ascend to greater heights by enhancing the previous Makefile (`1-Makefile`) with the introduction of variables for compiler and source files.
- **Noteworthy Enhancements**:
  - Unveiling the `CC` variable, bestowing the power of choice upon the compiler.
  - Embracing the `SRC` variable to illuminate the path to `.c` enlightenment.
  - Refinement of the `all` rule to recompile only the celestial sources touched by change.

### 2. Modularization Marvels

- **Objective**: Evolve our Makefile mastery with the refinement of Makefile (`2-Makefile`), introducing variables for object files and the manifestation of the executable.
- **Notable Modifications**:
  - Birth of the `OBJ` variable, heralding the arrival of the ethereal `.o` entities.
  - Definition of the `NAME` variable, bestowing a name upon the executable manifestation.

### 3. Purity in Purgation: Cleaning Rituals

- **Objective**: Embrace the cleansing flames of purification by expanding the horizons of Makefile (`3-Makefile`) with cleaning rules to banish temporary and executable files.
- **Sacred Inclusions**:
  - Invocation of the `clean` rule, purging Emacs/Vim transient entities and the almighty executable.
  - The venerable `oclean` rule, devoted to purifying the realm of object files.
  - The sanctified `fclean` rule, delivering deliverance from all transient entities, executable, and object files.
  - The rebirth-inducing `re` rule, enforcing the divine recompilation of all source files.
  - Introduction of the sacred `RM` variable, defining the command of file annihilation.

### 4. Fortification Through Compiler Flags

- **Objective**: Erect an impregnable fortress with the advanced Makefile (`4-Makefile`), infusing it with compiler flags for unwavering code quality.
- **Noteworthy Additions**:
  - Unveiling the `CFLAGS` variable, imbuing the compiler with divine wisdom encapsulated in flags such as `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`.

### 5. Embarking on Pythonic Adventures

- **Objective**: Venture into the realms of Python scripting with a practical task (`5-island_perimeter.py`) to unravel the mystery of island perimeters within a grid.
- **Expedition Highlights**:
  - Unveiling the Pythonic function `island_perimeter(grid)`, a beacon of light illuminating the path to perimeter enlightenment.

### 6. Mastering the Arcane Art: Advanced Makefile Sorcery

- **Objective**: Ascend to the pinnacle of Makefile mastery with the advanced rendition (`100-Makefile`), weaving intricate spells of additional features.
- **Auspicious Highlights**:
  - Embrace the absence of the `RM` variable, transcending the mundane realm of file deletion.
  - Shun the reliance on the `$(CFLAGS)` incantation, delving into realms untouched by convention.
  - Pay homage to the sacred `m.h` header through a meticulous dependency check.
  - Forge resilience in the face of adversity, navigating the treacherous waters of existing files with identical names to Makefile rules.
