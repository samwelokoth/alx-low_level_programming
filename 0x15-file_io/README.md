# File I/O in C Project

## Overview
This project is a demonstration of file input and output operations in the C programming language. It includes examples of reading from and writing to files using C functions.

## Features
- **File Reading:** This project provides examples of how to read data from a file using C's file I/O functions. You can learn how to open a file, read its content, and perform operations on the data.

- **File Writing:** It also demonstrates how to write data to a file. You can see how to create or open a file for writing and save data into it.

- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling is implemented throughout the code, showing how to deal with issues like file not found, permissions, or other errors gracefully.
