C - Even more pointers, arrays, and strings

This directory contains several files on the C programming language, which will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Tasks:

    memset: Implement the _memset function that fills a block of memory with a constant byte.
    memcpy: Implement the _memcpy function that copies a block of memory from one location to another.
    strchr: Implement the _strchr function that locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.
    strspn: Implement the _strspn function that calculates the length of the initial substring of a string that only contains characters from a specified set.
    strpbrk: Implement the _strpbrk function that locates the first occurrence in a string of any character from a specified set.
    strstr: Implement the _strstr function that locates a substring within a string.
    Chess is mental torture: Implement the print_chessboard function that prints a chessboard pattern.
    The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire: Implement the print_diagsums function that calculates the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
    Double pointer, double fun: Implement a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
    My primary goal of hacking was the intellectual curiosity, the seduction of adventure: Create a file that contains the password for the crackme2 executable.
