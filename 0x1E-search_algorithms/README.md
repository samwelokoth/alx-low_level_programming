# Search Algorithms

This project implements various search algorithms in C language. The algorithms include:

- Linear Search

Each algorithm is implemented in its own file and follows the specified requirements such as function prototypes, file names, and coding style.

## Compilation

To compile the project, use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 main.c 0-linear.c -o search_algos
