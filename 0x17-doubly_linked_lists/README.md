Doubly Linked Lists:

1. Definition: A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and two links (or pointers) - one pointing to the previous node and another pointing to the next node in the sequence.

2. Structure: Each node in a doubly linked list has three components: the data element, a pointer to the previous node, and a pointer to the next node. The first node's previous pointer and the last node's next pointer are usually set to null or some other special value indicating the end of the list.

3. Operations: Common operations on a doubly linked list include insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal. These operations can be performed at any position within the list, as each node has access to both its predecessor and successor.

4. Advantages: Doubly linked lists provide more flexibility than singly linked lists because they allow traversal in both directions (forward and backward). They also make insertion and deletion operations more efficient, as you can access the previous and next nodes directly from the current node.

5. Disadvantages: Doubly linked lists require more memory than singly linked lists, as each node stores two pointers instead of one. Additionally, some operations may be slightly slower due to the need to update both the previous and next pointers when modifying the list.
