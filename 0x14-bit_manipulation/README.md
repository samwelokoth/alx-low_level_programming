# C - Bit Manipulation (Project 0x14)

## Overview
This project explores bit manipulation techniques in the C programming language. Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science and is widely used for tasks like setting, clearing, toggling, and checking individual bits within data. This project provides hands-on experience and understanding of bitwise operations in C.

## Project Files
- [main.c](main.c): The main C file where bit manipulation operations are demonstrated.
- [bit_manipulation.h](bit_manipulation.h): The header file containing function declarations and descriptions.
- [0x14-bit_manipulation](0x14-bit_manipulation): The compiled binary executable for the project.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository (alx-low_level_programming.git) to your local machine.
2. Compile the project using your preferred C compiler.
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -o  *.c
## Features
- Demonstrations of various bit manipulation techniques.
- Clear explanations and comments in the code for better understanding.

## Contributing
Contributions and improvements are welcome. If you have suggestions or want to add more bit manipulation examples, please feel free to submit a pull request.
